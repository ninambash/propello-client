# User Story
1. As a real estate agent, I want to be able to create a new property listing so that I can add it to my portfolio.
2. As a real estate agent, I want to be able to update a property's details such as its price, description, and images so that I can keep my listings up-to-date.
3.As a property owner, I want to be able to delete a property if I no longer want to keep it in my portfolio.

 # MVP Goals
 1.Create a user authentication system that allows real estate agents  and property owners to sign up and log in to the app.
2.Implement the ability to create new properties, including entering all relevant information such as the address, number of rooms, price, etc.
3.Develop a system to display all properties and allow users to view each property's details.
4.Allow users to edit and update existing property listings.
5.Implement the ability to delete properties from the user's portfolio.


 # stretch goals
1.Implement a search function that allows users to search for properties based on specific criteria such as location, price range, etc.
2.Add the ability for real estate agents and property owners to upload images of the properties they are listing.
3.Implement a messaging system that allows users to communicate with each other about properties.
4.Integrate with mapping services to display the location of properties on a map.


 # potential roadblocks
1. Implementing secure user authentication and authorization.
2. Ensuring that the app's interface is user-friendly and intuitive.
3. Integrating the app with mapping services and ensuring accurate property locations.
4. Ensuring that the app can handle a large number of properties and user data.
5. Dealing with slow loading times and performance issues as the app grows.
